# Python Notes

- ##### **Python Defination**
  - Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.
  - It is used for a wide variety of applications, including web development, data science
, machine learning
, and artificial intelligence.

- ##### **Argument Passing**
  - `import sys`  
    In Python, the **sys** module provides access to some variables and functions that interact with the Python interpreter and the system environment. It is particularly useful for system-specific operations and for interacting with the Python runtime environment.

- ##### **Python Comments**
  - Comments can be used to explain Python code.
  - Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
  - Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.
  - **ex.**
    > `#This is a comment`
>
- ##### **Variables**
  - Variables are containers for storing data values.
  - Python has no command for declaring a variable.
  - A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
  - ##### Role to create variable
    1. A Python variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
    2. A Python variable name cannot start with a number.
    3. A Python variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).
    4. Variable in Python names are case-sensitive (name, Name, and NAME are three different variables).
    5. The reserved words(keywords) in Python cannot be used to name the variable in Python.
  - ##### Global Variables
    - Variables that are created outside of a function (as in all of the examples above) are known as global variables.
    - Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.
